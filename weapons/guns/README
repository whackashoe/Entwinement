You can create weapon xml files. Here is copy pasted code, I'll document when I have time:

<gun ammo="int" speed="int" radius="float" density="float" restitution="float" friction="float" reloadtime="int" delaytime="int" damage="int">name of gun</gun>

reloadtime and delaytime are specified in tics(1/60th second)
restitution is for bouncy bullets, see raygun
friction example is in grenade file

<setBink amount="float"></setBink>
amount of "push" when hitting a player

<setRecoil amount="float"></setRecoil>
amount of self push when firing

<setAccuracy amount="float"></setAccuracy>
overall accuracy of weapon

<setSniper sightMult="float"></setSniper>
sightMult is multiplication of sight

<setSniperLine></setSniperLine>

<setAutomatic></setAutomatic>
May hold mouse button to shoot multiple times

<setShotgun shells="int"></setShotgun>

<setBoom radius="int" timer="int"></setBoom>
makes bullet explode on impact, timer is length of explosion in tic(1/60th second)

 
<setDelayExplode delay="int" radius="int" timer="int" explodeOnSoldierImpact="boolean"></setDelayExplode>

<setSpeedMultBasedOnMouse xMult="float" yMult="float"></setSpeedBasedOnMouse>
used for throwable weapons

<setBullet>bulletgfx.png</setBullet>
sets bullet to sprite found in mods/(name)/gfx/guns/bullets


<setSound distance="float">noise.wav</setSound>
sets noise for shooting, distance is maximum distance away you can hear it- the sound is scaled to distance


<setGun>gungfx.png</setGun>
sets gun to sprite found in mods/(name)/gfx/guns/weapons

<setFlame></setFlame>
makes bullets on fire

<setNoMoveAcc></setNoMoveAcc>
makes gun not take into accound your speed when bullet is shot

<setFollow returnRadius="float" zDepth="float" zDepthMinus="float"></setFollow>
makes the camera follow bullet,

returnRadius- the distance of mouse from center that the camera will stay on soldier (for close quarter)- you can set it to 0 for no effect
zDepth- zoom in/out of camera
zDepthMinus- zDepth is subtracted by this

<setControllable strength="float"></setControllable>
make bullets controllable by mouse position

<setLifespan>int</setLifespan>
amount of time in tics the bullet stays alive if it hasnt already hit something
