Map repositories go here, they tie together:
 gun lists found in the entwinement/weapons/lists directory,
 maps found in the entwinement/maps/data directory,
 scripts found in the entwinement/scripts directory, 
 
 
You can set the width, height, and gravity with the worldData tag:
<worldData width="10000" height="5000" gravityX="0" gravityY="100"></worldData>

The width and height is evenly distributed to the left or right, 
so in this example the world would span from -5000 -> 5000 for x coords and -2500 -> 2500 for y coords.
Placing polygons or spawns outside these perimeters will cause errors and crashes that can be mysterious, 
make sure to check if the world size is large enough for your maps.

You can load map files with the mapData tag, src corresponds to file in /data directory
<mapData src="1vs1Arena.PMS" xOffset="0" yOffset="0" scaleW="1.0" scaleH="1.0"></mapData>

The xOffset and yOffset tags move everything that exists in the map that many units.
Likewise scale affects the overall size, to turn maps upside down you may use -1 for scaleH,
or -1 for scaleW to make them reverse.

The gunlist tag loads the guns to use.
<gunlist src="list1.xml"></gunlist>

You may want to comment this tag out or omit it if you are loading a single xml map or
loading guns from a script. If you load maps after placing this tag they may overwrite the gunlist.

The script tag loads a script, and you may call initial functions from within it.
<script src="splotch" version="1">
splotch.createSplotch(0, 0, 10, 500)
</script>

This would load a script named splotch_v1.py from the scripts folder, note: you must specify version for loading.
An object is created by the name of the script, so in this case you may call splotch functions from other scripts by
prepending splotch to the function call as seen above.



Example: maprepo.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<repo>
<worldData width="10000" height="5000" gravityX="0" gravityY="100"></worldData>
<mapData src="map_layer1.PMS" xOffset="0" yOffset="0" scaleW="1.0" scaleH="1.0"></mapData>
<mapData src="map_layer2.PMS" xOffset="-500" yOffset="-1000" scaleW="1.0" scaleH="-1.0"></mapData>
<gunlist src="list1.xml"></gunlist>
<script src="splotch" version="1">
